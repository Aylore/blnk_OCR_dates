# blnk_OCR_Dates

A common problem with digital transformation is to automatically digitize the documents, this is
time consuming as someone manually data-entries the information, but as AI emerged, there
are a lot of ways to do so without human involvement. Optical character recognition (OCR) is
the process of reading the numbers, characters and words from images.
Weâ€™d like you to tackle the problem of extracting dates from images.
